When you run the following code...

    def equal_to_four(x)
      if x == 4
        puts "yup"
      else
        puts "nope"
    end

    equal_to_four(5)


You get the following error message..

test_code.rb:96: syntax error, unexpected end-of-input, expecting keyword_end


Answer:  The method has been closed but not the if statement. To fix, the code should be as follows:


 def equal_to_four(x)
    if x == 4
      puts "yup"
    else
      puts "nope"
    end
 end

    equal_to_four(5)
